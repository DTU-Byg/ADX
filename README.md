# ADX - Agile Design Experience
 This repo follows the devlopment of the Agile Building Design Agile Design Experience.

# Thread 1: Grasshopper
* Simulation - send the data to the cloud
* alert user that simmulation is finished / results are done / error an email when done. 
* Try not to recalculate the geometry each time

## Simulate in the cloud
If some work is done in the cloud, what work should we do locally? what should be on your machine - GDPR - perspective all your own data? asynchronous processes on the cloud, synchronous processes on the ground.

## Email alert
google api - mail bot - licensing etc. to be investigated.

## Don't do that again!
Avoid repeating calculations unneccessarily. Use similar parameters - reuse parts of models where possible. Results are precious. 

# Thread 2: Rhino inside Revit
* send native GH geometry to Revit
* support disciplines in their native programs.
* Display feedback in the most useful program to them. (Don't have to go somewhere else to get feedback).

## send GH geo to Revit.

## support disciplines in their native programs.

## Don't have to go somewhere else to get feedback

# Thread 3: Speckle 2.0
* what should we use to send data in the design team.
* speckle knows who sent the data - and when it was sent
* it in a speckle project which will give us the data.
* can we use speckle as an open alternative model and information sharing environment?
