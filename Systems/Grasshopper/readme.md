# Analysis
Introduction 

In front of you is a series of tests that can be done as part of the building design process. 
The main goal is to allow these analyzes to constitute an optimization process at an early stage,and during the process, not only when the model is far advanced.

please notice that each analysis has its own modification, settings that need to calibrated before use.
We advise you to execute each code individually in order to avoid overloading the testing process

 
**Acoustics** 

This script focuses on obtaining values ​​that help determine if the materials selected for a particular space 
are appropriate for the type of activity desired.

1.Download from "FOOD4RHINO"- PachyDerm_Acoustic plug in for Grasshopper and rhino
2. Pick a spcae where you want to test this area and make sure it is opened in rhino program
3. Divied the different surfaces into mateirals, by  seperting to layers.
4. open in rhino PachyDerm_Acoustic ( make sure you have installed this plug-in prior to this step, see number 1) 
5. Define each layer a matireal with Absorption,scattering,Transparency values.
6. when finished press "save Material"
7. Indisde the script follow the notes and guidlines 
8. after setting all the inputs, enable analyze component
9. review result.
10. make adjustments accordingly
